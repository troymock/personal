description: "<p>The design for Endgame centers around its 5.5in titanium spinning bar. This bar spins at 5000rpm, or 80 revolutions a second, to transfer its kinetic energy into its opponent. The front titanium wedges are angled to scoop and lift the opponent into the spinning blade. There are a number of custom details in the design, such as the pocketed weapon shaft that acts a structural frame member, and the wheels that are recessed for protection. </p>"
