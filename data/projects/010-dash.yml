description: "<p>Interning with the UI department of Salesforce over the summer of 2015, I was tasked with creating a quiz-like gamification for the unveiling of their Lightning Design System. This project was aimed to educate Salesforce users about the possibilities of the Design System. I researched, ideated, and designed all facets of the gameâ€“ from the screen layout to award system and animation.</p> <p>There are three game types: general multiple choice, timed memory, and timed multiple choice.</p>"
