description: "<p>The revision for Endgame aims to improve on the flaws of the original design. Namely, the instability caused by the gyroscopic forces of such a large blade, and the decreased driving maneuverability due to the friction of the front wedges against the arena floor. The custom 3.5in asymmetric disc reduces Endgameâ€™s center of gravity, and the non-recessed blade allows easier weapon contact with the opponent. Also, the single weapon tooth of the blade increases weapon bite for maximum damage.</p>"
